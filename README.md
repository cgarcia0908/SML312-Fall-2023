# sml312
This project was done as a part of SML312: Research Projects in Data
Science offered by Princeton University in Fall 2023. A very special
thanks to Matt and Will Courchene for allowing me access to the data
used in this project. Also thank you very much to Mr. Hanke, for such a
great semester and preceptors Rajita and Jake for all the constructive
criticism.

I will note that much of this analysis was improved upon after the
submission of the original paper in class and that I intend to continue
improving the paper and the analysis in the future. In the meantime,
however, please pay close attention to the project notebook as there are
descriptions and analysis that are better described or were not 
mentioned in the original paper.

I also removed the API key from the data download notebook out of 
respect for the generosity of Matt and Will. All data, can be sourced,
from their site (https://datagolf.com/) however, or can also be scraped 
(with a lot of difficulty) from the PGA Tour website. To preserve the
original output of the notebook I have included the exported PDF.
